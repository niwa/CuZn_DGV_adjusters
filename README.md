# Code to adjust draft DGVs for copper and zinc
This code enables users to adjust the draft default guideline values (DGVs) for copper and zinc in freshwater. The draft DGVs are those submitted to ANZG in 2023. Those draft DGVs may change and if so the code here will be updated.

## Dependencies
To use the code for zinc, you need the following:
1) The Burrlioz application must be installed on your computer. Download from here: 
https://research.csiro.au/software/burrlioz/
2) Rdata files with the required zinc toxicity data and MLR parameters. These are found in the data folder and need to be saved into a folder on your drive.
